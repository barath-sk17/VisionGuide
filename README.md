# Third-Eye ( Real-Time Object Detection App )

This Android application demonstrates real-time object detection using TensorFlow Lite and a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model. The app captures video from the device's camera and overlays detected objects on the live camera feed. It also utilizes TextToSpeech to announce the detected objects verbally.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using TensorFlow Lite.
- Integration of TextToSpeech for verbal announcements of detected objects.
- Display of detected objects on the live camera feed.

## Prerequisites

- Android device running API level 21 or higher.
- Android Studio IDE (for development).
- Basic knowledge of Kotlin programming language and Android development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/barath-sk17/third-eye.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the app, grant the necessary camera permissions if prompted.

2. Point the camera at various objects to see real-time object detection in action.

3. Detected objects will be outlined with bounding boxes and labeled on the screen.

4. The app will also announce the detected objects verbally using TextToSpeech.

## Acknowledgments

This project utilizes the following technologies and resources:

- TensorFlow Lite: For running machine learning models on mobile and edge devices.
- SSD MobileNet model: A lightweight deep neural network for object detection tasks.
- Android Camera2 API: For accessing and controlling the device's camera.
- TextToSpeech API: For converting text to speech for verbal announcements.
